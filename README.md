# tensorflow_subcellular
Demo code of Tensorflow model and training for the prediction of subcellular localization.

Codes of this demo project are very similar to this paper:

Detecting Sequence Signals in Targeting Peptides Using Deep Learning 

J. J. Almagro Armenteros, M. Salvatore, O. Emanuelsson, O. Winther, G. von Heijne, A. Elofsson, H. Nielsen.

The demo code is written in Python 3 and Tensorflow 1.14 and use numpy and sklearn.

The model can be trained using a single GPU (1080 ti)
